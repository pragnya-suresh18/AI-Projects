# 👋 START HERE

Welcome to your **AWS Cloud Troubleshooting Assistant** project!

---

## 🎯 What You're Building

A **multi-agent AI system** that diagnoses cloud performance issues using natural language queries.

**Example:**
```
You: "Why did latency spike this morning?"

System: "Database slow query on payments table at 8:15 AM. 
         Recommend adding index on user_id column."
```

**Cost:** $0 (completely free!)

## ⏰ Choose Your Timeline

### 🏃 **Fast: 3-Day Sprint** (Recommended)

**Best for:** Quick MVP, tight deadlines, immediate results  
**Time:** 24-30 hours total (8-10 hours/day)  
**Outcome:** Working system with 3 agents + demo

**👉 Read Next:** [3_DAY_SPRINT.md](3_DAY_SPRINT.md) ⭐

---

### 🚶 **Comprehensive: 8-Week Journey**

**Best for:** Deep learning, production-ready system, all features  
**Time:** 4-6 weeks part-time (10-15 hours/week)  
**Outcome:** Full system with RAG, evaluation, polish

## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose One)

### Option A: 3-Day Sprint

```bash
# 1. Run setup
./setup.sh  # or setup.bat on Windows

# 2. Open sprint guide
open 3_DAY_SPRINT.md  # Read Day 1

# 3. Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# 4. Create first notebook
# notebooks/01_data_generation.ipynb
# Copy code from 3_DAY_SPRINT.md → Day 1 → Hours 2-4

# 5. Go! 🏃
```

**Day 1:** Data + Anomaly Detection  
**Day 2:** RCA + Reporting  
**Day 3:** Orchestration + Demo  

---

### Option B: 8-Week Journey

```bash
# 1. Run setup
./setup.sh  # or setup.bat on Windows

# 2. Read setup guide
open GETTING_STARTED.md

# 3. Read full spec
open PROJECT_SPEC.md

# 4. Start Week 1
jupyter notebook

# Follow Phase 1 from PROJECT_SPEC.md
```

**Weeks 1-4:** Individual agents  
**Weeks 5-6:** Integration + RAG  
**Weeks 7-8:** Evaluation + Polish

## 💡 Recommendations

### Do 3-Day Sprint If:
- ✅ You need something working quickly
- ✅ You have a deadline (interview, demo, etc.)
- ✅ You want to learn multi-agent basics fast
- ✅ You prefer hands-on, code-first approach

### Do 8-Week Journey If:
- ✅ You want to understand everything deeply
- ✅ You have time for thorough learning
- ✅ You want a production-ready system
- ✅ You prefer structured, incremental approach

**My suggestion:** Do the 3-day sprint first, then enhance it over the next weeks!

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: I have 3 days but only 3-4 hours/day. Can I still do it?
**A:** Yes! Spread it over 6-7 days. Follow the hour-by-hour guide in 3_DAY_SPRINT.md.

### Q: Is this really free?
**A:** Yes! Uses Ollama (local LLM) + static data files. Zero cost.

### Q: Do I need to know AI/ML?
**A:** Basic Python + understanding of agents/LLMs helps, but the guide walks through everything.

### Q: Can I put this on my resume?
**A:** Absolutely! See PROJECT_SUMMARY.md for ready-to-use resume bullets.

### Q: What if I get stuck?
**A:** All code is provided in 3_DAY_SPRINT.md. Copy-paste is totally fine!

## 📊 What You'll Have After 3 Days

✅ **Multi-agent system** with 3 specialized agents  
✅ **Natural language queries** ("Why did latency spike?")  
✅ **Synthetic dataset** (7 days, 3 incident types)  
✅ **Demo notebook** showing real results  
✅ **Professional reports** in markdown  
✅ **Portfolio project** for resume/interviews
